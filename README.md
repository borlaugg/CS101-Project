# CS101-Project
THE GAME OF LASSO:

the game consists of 10 distinct levels with a special bonus at round 5. The user is given the choice to select the difficulty of  the level at the start. Collect yellow coloured 'coins' to gain points and avoid the black 'bombs' they make you loose your coins. Collection of the bonus at level five gives you two additional coins, but this is optional, you need not collect it to progress in your game. After level 5 the game automaticaally gets difficult with the coins and bombs moving in parabolas and not in straight lines. Along with this an additional bomb begins to move after level 5. At the end of the game, that is once the player has completed all levels a message appears saying game over and his/her high score appears. If the bonus wasn't collected in level 5 and progresses, it's possible for the player to come back to level 5(by collecting bombs) and collect the bonus so as to achieve the highest score. The bonus can only be collected once.
